# Example Conversations

This document demonstrates the context-driven approach through realistic conversation examples, showing how requirements evolve through dialogue and how context builds naturally over time.

## Starting a Feature
```
Human: I need to add payment processing to our app.

Claude: I'll help you implement payment processing. Let me create a specification file to capture our discussion as we explore the requirements.

*Creating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md*

Now, let me understand your payment requirements better:
- What payment methods do you need to support?
- Will you process payments directly or use a provider?
- What currencies and regions do you need to handle?
- Do you need subscription support or just one-time payments?

I'll update our specification file as we discuss these requirements...
```

## Refining Requirements
```
Human: Users should be able to save payment methods for future use.

Claude: Let me formalize this into EARS requirements and update our specification:

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Requirements Section*

- WHEN a user successfully completes a payment THEN the system SHALL offer to save the payment method
- WHERE a user opts to save a payment method the system SHALL store a tokenized reference
- The system SHALL NOT store actual card numbers, only payment provider tokens
- IF a saved payment method fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for an alternative

Should we also consider:
- Maximum number of saved payment methods?
- Default payment method selection?
- PCI compliance requirements?

I'll add these to our open questions section in the spec file.
```

## Design Evolution
```
Claude: For payment processing, I see three architectural approaches:

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Architecture Decisions*

1. **Direct Integration** with Stripe/PayPal
   - Pros: Full control, single vendor
   - Cons: Complex PCI compliance

2. **Payment Service Abstraction**
   - Pros: Provider flexibility, cleaner architecture
   - Cons: Additional complexity layer

3. **Hosted Checkout**
   - Pros: Minimal PCI scope, quick implementation
   - Cons: Less control over UX

Given your requirements for saving payment methods and quick implementation, 
I'd lean toward #1 with Stripe. Their vault handles tokenization securely.
What are your thoughts?

I'll document this decision and rationale in our Architecture Decisions section.
```

## Test-Driven Implementation
```
Human: Let's implement the payment creation endpoint using TDD.

Claude: Perfect! Let's start with the failing tests. Before we code, let me check our specification completeness:

*Checking: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md*

‚úÖ Requirements documented (8 functional, 3 non-functional)
‚úÖ Architecture decisions captured (Stripe integration chosen)
üîÑ Now adding test specifications...

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Testing Strategy*

Based on our requirements, here are the test cases:

```python
async def test_successful_payment_creates_charge():
    """WHEN valid payment data submitted THEN system SHALL create charge"""
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/payments", json={
        "amount": 2999,  # $29.99
        "currency": "USD",
        "payment_method_id": "pm_test_123"
    })
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "succeeded"
    assert response.json()["amount"] == 2999

async def test_payment_failure_returns_error():
    """IF payment fails THEN system SHALL return clear error"""
    # Test implementation...
```

Run these - they should fail. Now let's implement the minimal code to make them pass...
```

## Handling Context Loss
```
Human: Wait, what were our security requirements for payments again?

Claude: Let me check our specification file for the security requirements:

*Reading: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Non-Functional Requirements*

Here are the security requirements we established:
- PCI DSS compliance through tokenization (never store raw card data)
- All payment data must be encrypted in transit (HTTPS only)
- Rate limiting: 10 payment attempts per user per hour
- Audit logging for all payment operations
- If suspicious activity detected, require additional verification

We also documented using Stripe's vault for secure token storage in our Architecture Decisions section. Should I show how these requirements affect our current implementation?
```

## Iterative Refinement
```
Human: The requirements look good, but I realized we need to handle partial refunds too.

Claude: Good catch! Let me update our specification with partial refund requirements:

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Requirements Section*

**Existing requirement:**
- WHEN a refund is requested THEN the system SHALL process full refund

**Refined requirements:**
- WHEN a refund is requested THEN the system SHALL support both full and partial refunds
- IF partial refund amount exceeds original payment THEN the system SHALL reject with error
- The system SHALL track cumulative refunds per payment
- WHERE multiple partial refunds exist the system SHALL NOT exceed original amount

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Design Details*

This changes our data model - we'll need a refunds table to track history. Should we also consider:
- Refund approval workflow?
- Time limits on refunds?
- Webhook handling for refund status updates?

I'll add these to our open questions and update the data model section.
```

## Discovery Through Implementation
```
Human: I'm implementing the webhook handler and realized Stripe can send duplicate events.

Claude: Excellent discovery! This is a critical issue. Let me update our specification:

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Requirements Section*

**New Requirements:**
- The system SHALL process each webhook event exactly once (idempotency)
- IF duplicate webhook received THEN the system SHALL return success without reprocessing
- The system SHALL store webhook event IDs with timestamps

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Design Details*

**Implementation approach:**
```python
class WebhookHandler:
    async def handle_stripe_event(self, event_id: str, event_data: dict):
        # Check if we've seen this event
        if await self.event_store.exists(event_id):
            return {"status": "already_processed"}
        
        # Process event...
        # Store event_id
```

This is why iterative development works well - implementation reveals requirements! I've captured this learning in our specification for future reference.
```

## Context Building Over Time
```
Human: Now I need to add subscription support. Can we build on what we have?

Claude: Absolutely! Let me create a subscription specification that builds on our existing payment infrastructure:

*Creating: specs/subscription-management/subscription-management.spec.md*
*Reading: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md for reusable components*

From our existing payment work, we can reuse:
- Payment method tokenization and storage
- Security requirements (PCI compliance, encryption)
- Webhook handling with idempotency
- Error handling patterns

*Updating: specs/subscription-management/subscription-management.spec.md - Requirements*

**New requirements for subscriptions:**
- WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL create recurring payment schedule
- The system SHALL support multiple subscription tiers
- WHERE subscription payment fails the system SHALL retry up to 3 times
- IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL suspend subscription access
- WHEN subscription cancelled the system SHALL maintain access until period ends

**Design considerations:**
Since we chose Stripe in our payment spec, we can use their Subscription API. Should we:
1. Store subscription state locally and sync with Stripe?
2. Use Stripe as source of truth with webhooks?
3. Hybrid approach with caching?

I'll document these options in our Architecture Decisions section. Your thoughts on state management?
```

## Continuous Learning
```
Human: After testing, I noticed our payment processing is slow. Any ideas?

Claude: Let me analyze this based on our current implementation and update our specification:

*Reading: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Design Details*

Current flow:
1. Validate input (5ms)
2. Create Stripe payment intent (200ms) ‚Üê Bottleneck
3. Store in database (20ms)
4. Send confirmation email (150ms) ‚Üê Also slow

*Updating: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Performance Optimization*

Optimization approaches:

**Quick wins:**
- Make email sending async - don't block payment response
- Pre-create payment intents for logged-in users

**Architectural changes:**
- Queue payment processing for better reliability
- Implement optimistic UI updates

```python
async def create_payment(self, payment_data: PaymentCreate):
    # Process payment with Stripe
    charge = await self.stripe.create_charge(...)
    
    # Store in DB
    await self.db.save_payment(charge)
    
    # Queue email (don't await)
    await self.queue.send("send_payment_email", {
        "payment_id": charge.id,
        "user_email": payment_data.email
    })
    
    return charge  # Return immediately
```

*Adding: specs/payment-processing/payment-processing.spec.md - Non-Functional Requirements*

Should we add performance requirements like "Payment processing SHALL complete within 300ms"?
```

## End-of-Session Reflection
```
Human: I think we've made good progress on payments. What did we accomplish?
