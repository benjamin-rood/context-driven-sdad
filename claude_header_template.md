# Claude Code Configuration

## Purpose and Intent

This configuration optimizes Claude Code for **spec-driven agentic development** - a collaborative approach where Claude acts as an intelligent development partner rather than a simple code generator. The goal is to move beyond "write this function" requests toward sophisticated specification development, architectural reasoning, and context-aware implementation planning.

By treating Claude as a domain expert who can engage in technical dialogue, explore requirements iteratively, and maintain project context across conversations, we enable more thoughtful software development that produces better specifications, cleaner implementations, and maintainable systems.

The methodology below prioritizes **understanding before implementation**, **conversation over commands**, and **accumulated context over isolated tasks**.
